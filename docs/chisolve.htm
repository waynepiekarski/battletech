<p>As the game begins, you find yourself in the Pacifica Training
School, and your only immediate objective is to complete the
training necessary to graduate as a Mech Warrior in the Lyran
Commonwealth Armed Forces. Explore the area. You start out
opposite the Citadel, where you should meet Katrina, and take
gunnery classes. Next door is Comstar, where the stock market can
be played. To your far left you will find your barracks.
Southeast of the barracks is the entrance to the Mech training
center. Other buildings you can enter are a Weapons shop, an
Armor shop, a Lounge, and a Mechit-Lube.</p>

<p>Most of the time, when entering a lounge or other building and
attempting to talk with somebody, nobody will be interested in
talking to you. In order to increase your opportunities, hang
around outside a building. When you see somebody enter the
building, follow them inside, and immediately try to talk. You'll
usually get a response, though this rarely leads to finding a new
party member; it's merely a diversion.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>MONEY</b></font><b><br>
</b>Probably the biggest factor in the whole game is money. No
money, no skill, no mech, no chance. The more cash the better
equipped you'll be for combat. Every five minutes or so your
account is boosted by fifteen credits as ma and pa robot decide
it's time to give some more of your allowance. Don't hang
around!! Initially invest in a low risk account and then move
onto the intermediate one. Do this for a few hours and you'll be
counting the wads, around 350,000 of 'em.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>RECOMMENDED STOCKS</b></font><b><br>
</b>Only two stocks are worth your while:</p>

<p>NASHAN DIVERSIFIED (NasDiv)<br>
BAKER PHARMACEUTICALS (BakPhar)</p>

<p>NasDiv is a steady performer, so if you do nothing but put all
your credits in this stock, you should amass quite a fortune by
the end of the game. BakPhar is a speculative stock that will
make you rich in a short time if your timing is right. One
strategy is to put most of your credits in NasDiv and a few in
BakPhar. Save regularly and check the market often. When BakPhar
starts going up, put all your credits in it, and usually your
money doubles and doubles again. It is essential to save your
game whenever you get ahead, though, for BakPhar's value can drop
to zero in no time! DEFIANCE INDUSTRIES OF HESPERUS (DefHes) is a
steady riser, good for safe long-term investment, but not a
money-maker.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>EXPLORING THE COMPOUND</b></font><b><br>
</b>After investing, leave Comstar and go and do something
(explore, rest, visit the weapons shop, take a training
lesson...), returning frequently to assess your holdings. It
takes a fairly long time to earn enough credits to buy a serious
weapon and good armour, not to mention the money you will need
for training, so you may have to wander about the compound
pointlessly, waiting for your stocks to go up (alternatively, you
could just load the game up and leave it running whilst you go do
something else for a few hours. By the time you get back, you
should have a small fortune in C-bills).</p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>TRAINING SCHOOL</b></font><b><br>
</b>Your main goal is to learn how to operate the Mechs at the
Training Centre. This will take at least six lessons, between
which you can explore the surrounding compound. The game requires
time to pass between lessons. </p>

<p>You'll not get far without training, and the first thing you
need to know is how to defend yourself. The important basics to
learn are rifle and machine gun, as these are the only weapon
skills you'll find yourself needing.</p>

<p>Stop off at the mechit-lube and take up an apprenticeship. I
know it's expensive, but it enables you to patch up a battlefield
mech, and take it in for a full repair and slap another member of
your party inside.</p>

<p>When it comes to combat training, try to move around as much
as possible and overheat as little as possible, and aim for speed
on all the missions as this contributes to your overall mech
skill.</p>

<p>Medical skill is a worthwhile venture; it'll make sure you
stay in the game longer. </p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><em>Note that if you proceed directly to
the northern towns after leaving the Compound and Starport, you
can meet the Doctor you'll need, and unless you failed to escape
the Training Ground with a mech, you'll never need a doctor
anyway, nor will you need weapon skills. Why? If you invest
wisely and wait until your stocks shoot up to sell, you can
afford a personal SRM launcher - the best anti-personnel weapon
in the game, it kills anybody in 1 shot, even with no skill by
the user. Jason will only use it once, escaping the Kurita
Inaugural Hall in Starport.. Rex, and later your Tech, will have
Good or better Tech skills, so you can likely skip getting these
for Jason as well.</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>WEAPONRY</b></font><b><br>
</b>Start off with a machine gun. It takes quite a few hits to
kill a human and has no effect on mechs whatsoever but, it's
relatively cheap. Later on try to get hold of a Laser Weapon, but
I recommend the SRM over all. One shot disposes of any human in
the game will certainly damage a mech. Whatever you do, don't
hang around taking on a twenty ton mech with a hand held SRM - it
just doesn't work (&quot;Jason had been squashed underfoot. Game
Over.&quot;). Equip yourself with a forty point armour, it
normally prevents any damage to the person in a typical combat
round (from other humans).</p>

<p>The SRM never runs out of ammunition and rarely misses, so
it's advisable to stay around until you can afford one......BUT -
you CAN get by with less firepower. Weapon shops are everywhere
throughout Pacifica, and you can also salvage weapons after
combat. Buy whatever armour you can afford for yourself and any
allies. Armour shops are in many towns. Get a MedKit (sold at any
of several hospitals) and a Mapper (at the video store in
Starport and a few other towns). Later on, get your Mechs
modified at a Mech-It Lube's Speed Shop and you'll become almost
invincible.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>MECH ETIQUETTE</b></font><b><br>
</b>First and foremost, with the lump of cash you should have by
now, any mech you own should be customised at the mechit-lube,
extra lasers and armour always come in handy at the expense of
jump jets and missile launchers. Never rule out kicking, more
often than not it proves to be invaluable when a mech is close to
shutdown. Always try to face an attacking mech, all it could take
is one hit with a small laser to the back to knock out half your
arsenal.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>THE INVASION</b></font><b><br>
</b>On the 6th or 7th training mission, you'll suddenly face real
opponents - the Kuritans, who have invaded the compound with four
Jenners (no, they can't be salvaged, and you'll never see them
again). You've got to escape to Starport, a neutral city
northeast of the starting point. If you're lucky, you'll escape
with a Mech.</p>

<p>There are two ways to do so. Choose a Locust for your final
mission, then head West when the forcefield around the training
grounds disappears, and get out of town. Or use a Chameleon and,
as soon as you're attacked, walk back into the building you just
left. When the walls come down, exit West out of the city.
Sometimes neither of these methods are successful! If that
happens, you can get Mechs at several other points.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>STARPORT</b></font><b><br>
</b>Head North to Starport (on the Overhead Map, the little arrow
always points toward it). Save frequently if you decide to fight
attackers in the hope of obtaining money and equipment. Inside,
immediately find the Clothing Store and get rid of your uniform
to avoid being attacked as often. Then check your stocks at
Comstar and re-invest if desired. Check out the Inaugural Hall to
learn of the Inauguration, then you might want to earn credits by
fighting at the Arena. Repairs can be costly if using a rental
Mech, however, and may even exceed your 250-credit payoff, so it
usually doesn't pay (but see below). There's also an Electronics
shop in the Northwest of town where you can buy a holodisc player
(if you don't feel like going back to the Citadel later) or a
Mapper, which reveals the area around Starport without your
having to explore it - but by now, you already have. <font
color="#FFFF00"><em>NOTE: you have no mech at all and need a free
one, you can rent an Arena mech, shoot out the thinnest section
of the Western grandstands (oh, the carnage!), and run away -
however, you'll lose any mechs that were in the garage, and
Starport will never let you back in, so make sure you're
desperate. Also, if you have Rex and your Expert Tech with you,
this can be your chance to get the only Urbanmech in the game!
Yes, it's a slug of a mech, but that AC10 is the longest-ranged
and deadliest gun in CHI (without hacking). Here's how: rent a
mech, check the opponent, and reload if it's not the Urbanmech
(the chances of the Urbie appearing are about 1 in 100). Head
West, hiding to avoid the AC10 shots. Shoot out the bleachers,
then run outside, but stay next to the outer Arena wall; if you
get too far from the outer wall, the &quot;steal a mech&quot;
dialogue plays. Wait until the Urbie comes to you (coax it out
gently), then kill it. With EXTEME luck, you might be able to
salvage it, since neither Rex nor Russ will have a mech after
your little gore-fest in the stands. The chances are VERY low,
but it's been done. The Urb can't be modified, but why would you
want to?</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>REX PEARCE &amp; THE CRESCENT HAWKS</b></font><b><br>
</b>At the Inaugural Hall later that night you'll meet Rex
Pearce, an ally. Save the game before entering, since you might
get killed when you leave with him (but not if you have the
recommended armor and SRM launcher!). Rex gives you a box from
your father and says he's got a new Commando Mech that Katrina
left him.</p>

<p>A member of the Crescent Hawks, he says your mission is to
round up other Hawks, find a secret cache of spare Mech parts
your father hid, and signal Archon Katrina to return to Pacifica
for the parts and your team.</p>

<p>But the enemy attacks before you can look at the holocard in
the box (which is necessary to locate the cache), and the card is
damaged. If you survive, you can roam about Starport gathering
gear, earning credits and skills, having Rex's Commando modified
at the Speed Shop and so on. <font color="#FFFF00"><em>NOTE:
Speed Shops won't modify the Jaevlin, Spider, Urbanmech, or
Chameleon; the Wasp, Stinger, Locust, and Commando all get two
modifications each, all worth the money.</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><strong>NOTE ON TRAITORS</strong></font><br>
Rex will never turn against you, but after this point, beware!
Save your game before entering Mechit-Lubes, Hospitals, or the
Jail in case you meet one of the Crescent Hawks. Sometimes,
they're Draconis Agents. After adding a party member, Inspect
them several times. If it says &quot;something's not right&quot;
or &quot;he's nervous&quot;, keep inspecting him until you
discover his treachery, then kill him. Problem is, some versions
of the game have only ONE of each character in them - Tech,
Medic, Stinger Pilot - so if the one you find is a traitor, you
can't finish the game. If you find a slimeball like this, reload
your last saved game and try the agent again, avoiding that
particular Mechit-Lube or Hospital if he keeps turning up a
scumball. Keep trying over again if it's at the Jail.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>THE JAIL &amp; THE UNDERCOVER AGENT</b></font><b><br>
</b>Go East-Northeast from Starport to a small town with a jail
and hospital. Save right away, for you may meet an ally who turns
out to be an undercover agent. If you're having trouble getting
people to talk, or if services like Mechit-Lube are always
closed, you've got an agent in the group. Put him outside on foot
and get into a few battles. He'll either be killed by the enemy
or Rex if he's a traitor; if not, you'll have a free Stinger and
a competent pilot. If you don't have your own Mech, steal one
from the Jail's parking garage.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>FINDING THE OTHER HAWKS, DR. TELLHIM
&amp; THE CACHE</b></font><b><br>
</b>There are two places to view the damaged holocard. The
easiest, quickest way is to return to the destroyed Citadel and
go to your barracks. You'll find a holocard viewer and can see
most of the message. The second way is to go to one of the
several towns Southwest of Starport. One has the Mayor's house in
it, and you can pick the lock and enter. Use the Mayor's holocard
viewer and you learn that you must find Dr. Tellhim at his hut in
the Northwest. He'll say where to find the cache. (His hut won't
appear on the map unless you view the holocard).</p>

<p>Head Northwest, exploring the various towns. There are several
cities in the game, all of which are easily found (they have no
names, and most have no special features). You need to pick up
two more Crescent Hawks; one is a Doctor, found by visiting
hospitals, checking the records and talking to people there. Get
him a MedKit and Field Surgery to recover faster from wounds.
Also, make sure to have him attend a Medical Seminar to raise his
Medic skill to Excellent.</p>

<p>Your other ally is a Tech, found by visiting the Mechit-Lubes
and asking to TALK and Apprentice. It's invaluable to get him
additional Tech training, for he can scavenge spare parts from
enemy Mechs that you destroy, thus earning you money as well as
simplifying repairs to your own Mechs. Make sure to have him
Apprentice to raise his Tech skill to Excellent.</p>

<p>Tellhim is in a building in the West of Pacifica located near
the water, near Sector 36/40 x 49/20. With the proper crew
(Excellent Tech, Medic, and Pilot [Rex]) and gear, you'll pass
his tests and he'll tell you that the cache is on an island to
the Southeast (39/60 x 55/60). Once there, enter the cave. <font
color="#FFFF00">Click </font><a href="chi-map.gif"><strong>HERE</strong></a><font
color="#FFFF00"> for a map showing his Hut and the Cache.</font></p>

<p><font color="#00FF00"><b>THE COMPUTER TERMINALS</b></font><br>
You are in a maze full of locked doors and computer terminals.
You have with you a keycard that needs to be imprinted with one
red number, one blue number, and one yellow number to open each
door. Each computer throughout the complex has its own special
colour coded number that can imprint your key-card, and each
computer's code can be used only once. You must open ELEVEN
different doors (that's 33 different computer colour imprints you
must find!), to get to the Map Room and the Power Transmitter.
The combinations are different for each door, and the keycard can
only hold one &quot;number&quot; of each color. Thus, you could
bump up against one machine and get, for example, RED 1. Then, if
you bumped up against another and got RED 2, your card would now
be imprinted with RED 2 only; RED 1 has been replaced. If you do
the same for BLUE and YELLOW, your card will now be temporarily
imprinted with one red, one blue, and one yellow.</p>

<p>Using the arrangement described, you will be able to open the
doors in alphabetical order. There is some flexibility, although
at least the first three doors must be opened in the order listed
on the map. After you print out the map, you may find that
whiting-out or crossing off the map's machines and doors as you
finish with them may make your task easier.</p>

<p>Remember that your card can only hold the registration for one
number of each color at a time. Thus, if you have the correct
blue number, and while getting your red or yellow number you
accidentally access another blue machine, you will have to go
back and &quot;re-register&quot; your correct blue number.</p>

<p>To find your father's secret Mech (the one that will net you a
free Battletech miniature from Infocom, &quot;while supplies
last&quot;), move south along the corridor on the western wall,
where you found the Y21 machine. Keep going, even though the
corridor apparently ends. Voila - Phoenix Hawk LAM.</p>

<p>When you have located and opened the door to the Map Room, you
enter it and must then activate a combination of seven planets
(PESHT, BENJAMIN, SKYE, SUMMER, RYERSON, KATHIL, ACHERNAR) to get
the password. <font color="#FFFF00">Click </font><a
href="chicode2.gif"><strong>HERE</strong></a><font

seven planets highlighted in yellow squares</font> (see also Page
14 of the original manual). Activate the planets by touching them
all, then walk over to the control panel on the West wall for
your password. </p>

<p>Go back upstairs to the power room and turn on the power.
Proceed next door to the transmitter room and turn on the
transmitter (by walking into it) to call Archon Katrina Steiner.
There's a brief congratulatory closing sequence.</p>
