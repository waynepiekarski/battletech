Use dosbox-debug

Keys:
ALT + FN + P (Alt+Pause on Framework laptop keyboard) - break debugger at current location
F10 - step over
F11 - step into
F5 - run
Control + F5 - capture screenshot to ~/.dosbox
Alt + Enter - fullscreen mode

BPM A000:013F - breakpoint at memory location for pixel (319,0) top right pixel of screen

CTRL+F11 - slow down CPU
Slow down the CPU and then move the character left, you will see the refresh happen
ALT+FN+P to break during the refresh

CPU will be at 1A21:2559 which is a "repe movsb" instruction. Each of these
instructions refreshes one scanline.

"movs copies data from ds:esi to es:edi and increments or decrements the pointers"
F3 A4	REP MOVS m8, m8	ZO	Valid	Valid	Move (E)CX bytes from DS:[(E)SI] to ES:[(E)DI].
CX is the counter, which in this case is 0x1B or 27d, not sure why 27?

MEMDUMPBIN 0:0 FFFFFF - save out 1M of memory

Gimp can load *.data files with a raw image loader that you can specify width x height

BattleTech needs to be run in MCGA mode to use a proper linear framebuffer. If you use
EGA/VGA mode then it uses a weird planar mode where the framebuffer is not easy to decode.
